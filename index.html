                    <p>
                        Dear Sundsgårdens Folkhögskola Recruitment Team,
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I hope this letter finds you well. My name is Sam Lekkla, and I am writing to express my keen
                        interest in the Backend Developer program at Sundsgårdens Folkhögskola.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Currently, I am pursuing studies in Frontend Development, and while I have thoroughly enjoyed my
                        journey in this field, I find myself increasingly drawn to the complexities and challenges of
                        backend development. It is this burgeoning interest that has led me to explore opportunities to
                        further my skills and knowledge in this domain.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Through my ongoing studies in frontend development, I have gained a solid foundation in web
                        technologies, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These skills have enabled me to create
                        dynamic
                        and user-friendly interfaces, and I have found great satisfaction in bringing designs to life
                        through code. However, as I delved deeper into the intricacies of web development, I became
                        increasingly fascinated by the backend processes that power the functionality of the
                        applications we
                        use every day.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In addition to my academic pursuits, I have had the privilege of gaining practical experience as
                        an
                        IT Coordinator. In this role, I was responsible for managing various IT systems and providing
                        technical support to users within the organization. This experience not only honed my
                        problem-solving abilities but also gave me valuable insights into the inner workings of IT
                        infrastructure. It was during this time that I realized my passion for technology and the
                        profound
                        impact it can have on businesses and individuals alike.
                    </p>


                    <p>
                        The dynamic and ever-evolving nature of the IT industry excites me, and I am eager to continue
                        learning and growing within this field. I believe that the Backend Developer program at
                        Sundsgården
                        will provide me with the perfect opportunity to expand my skill set and delve deeper
                        into the world of backend development. I am particularly drawn to your program's hands-on
                        approach
                        and emphasis on real-world projects, as I believe this practical experience will be invaluable
                        in
                        preparing me for a successful career in the industry.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Moreover, I am impressed by the supportive and inclusive community that Sundsgårdens fosters. I
                        am
                        eager to collaborate with fellow students and mentors who share my passion for
                        technology and innovation, and I am confident that the learning environment at your institution
                        will
                        enable me to thrive both personally and professionally.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In conclusion, I am deeply motivated to pursue a career in backend development, and I am
                        convinced
                        that the Backend Developer program at Sundsgårdens Folkhögskola is the ideal stepping stone
                        towards
                        achieving this goal. I am committed to dedicating myself wholeheartedly to my studies and making
                        the
                        most of the opportunities that your esteemed institution has to offer.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Thank you for considering my application. I am excited about the possibility of joining your
                        program
                        and look forward to the opportunity to contribute to and learn from the vibrant community at
                        Sundsgården Folkhögskola.
                    </p>

                    development, I am poised to embark on the next phase of my learning journey, diving into the
                    intricacies
                    of backend development. This dual expertise paves the way for me to emerge as a well-rounded
                    full-stack
                    developer, equipped with the proficiency to tackle every layer of application development with
                    confidence and finesse.

                <p class="page4__p">These are 3 of the projects I completed as part of my frontend development course
                    both "in team" and individually. The assignments
                    involved cloning a website using SASS and developing it further with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

                <h3 class="page4__h3">HTML AND CSS TEST PROJECT</h3>
                <p class="page4__p">In this project, the "Skill Test" demanded a comprehensive approach, requiring
                    meticulous planning,
                    execution, and testing. Firstly, understanding the design provided through the Figma file was
                    essential to interpret its intricacies accurately. This initial comprehension phase laid the
                    groundwork for subsequent tasks. Planning involved breaking down the design into its components and
                    structuring the HTML document accordingly, ensuring semantic markup for accessibility and SEO
                    benefits.
                </p>
                <p class="page4__p">
                    Execution comprised implementing the HTML structure, configuring settings like favicon integration,
                    and organizing image assets for efficiency. Sass was utilized to construct a modular and scalable
                    CSS architecture, aligning with the design's layout and responsiveness requirements. Simultaneously,
                    JavaScript functionality was integrated to enhance user interactivity, focusing on features like
                    navigation menus and scroll-down animations.

                <p class="page4__p">
                    Comprehensive testing was pivotal to verify functionality across diverse browsers and devices, with
                    meticulous documentation of any issues encountered. This meticulous approach ensured the project met
                    quality standards, with iterative refinements made to address any imperfections. Effective
                    communication with stakeholders throughout the process facilitated clarity and alignment with
                    expectations, culminating in the successful delivery of a high-quality end product.</p>

                    classmates. Our task was to build HTML and CSS for a website with the theme "DISC JOCKEY," assigned
                    by our instructor. We kicked off by planning the project layout using Figma. Tasks were delegated,
                    and I was responsible for developing the "CONTACT" page section. Leveraging CSS grid, I meticulously
                    positioned various sections on the page to align with our vision. Prior to the deadline, we
                    conducted final tests and added any necessary finishing touches to ensure completeness.</p>

                    This "TaskManage" project assignment during my JavaScript period focused solely on coding JavaScript
                    for TaskManage functionalities. The function took the form of a prompt-style alert at the top of the
                    page. Starting with object and array creation to store all tasks, I then developed functions to add
                    new tasks. Ensuring users couldn't leave fields blank and followed step-by-step instructions, I
                    implemented alerts for user guidance and feedback. I meticulously tested the code to ensure
                    everything functioned correctly before submission.</p>
